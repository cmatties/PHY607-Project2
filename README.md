# Monte Carlo Simulation for Particles Confined by Thermal Walls
## Authors: Fangyi Guo, Carter Matties
## PHY 607 Project 2

 * To generate position and velocity distribution plots for particles in an $r^2$ potential, run `harmonic`.
 * To generate average particle speed distribution plots for hard particles, run `mb_distribution`.
 * To generate Pressure(temperature) plots for hard particles, run `pressure`.
 * To generate time complexity plot, run `time_complexity`
 
 > WARNING
 > 
 > `mb_distribution` and `pressure` are both slow to run, taking ~5 minutes and ~8 minutes, respectively.

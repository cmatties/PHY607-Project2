1. Main methods
    a. Initialize a run of the simulation, given an initial probability distribution for speeds, number of particles, particle type, and thermal bath temperature
    b. Evolve 1 time step
        i. For each particle, get interactions with other particles and evolve velocity & position
    ii. For each particle, check for interactions with walls and update velocity according to rule, update position to make sure particles don't get out of bounds
        iii. Track the number of 
    c. Run simulation for N time steps
        i. For each time step, record the speed distribution, the total perpendicular components of the velocities involved in wall collisions
    
2. Parent class: particle
    a. Utility methods: Get/set velocity, get/set position, get speed
    b. Method to get interaction rule with walls: See equation (3)

3. Subclass 1: Central force particles
    a. Inherits utility & wall-interaction methods from Particle class
        i. Returns v_new
    b. Method to get interaction rule with other particles: 1/r potential, i.e. Coulomb force between positively charged particles
        i. Parameters: One other particle's position, velocity
        ii. Returns v_new

4. Subclass 2: Particles without central force
    a. Inherits utility & wall-interaction methods from Particle class
        i. Returns v_new
    b. Particle-particle interactions: If particles are within a small distance of each other, do an elastic collision. Otherwise, particles do not interact
        i. Parameters: One other particle's position, velocity
        ii. Returns v_new
    
5. Plots
    a. Initial and final speed distributions for a given simulation
    b. Mean kinetic energy per particle over time
    c. Pressure, as computed via proposal eqn. 6, over time
